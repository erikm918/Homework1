# Homework 1

## Question 1
Determines if plane is within flight limitations. If not, it attempts to create a situation such that this is possible. There is certainly a better way of determining how much fuel must be added/removed to reach limitations for the center of gravity, I will come back to that at a later date. 

Solution currently works. Tested a fuel amount (231lbs) that would put the plane overweight, then the center of gravity would be less than the allowable.

## Question 2
Basic containers that should work. 

## Question 3 & 4
Plane class. Currently not functional, need to spend time on the constructor and calling the function in the main file.
